//2 The area of the triangle is 100 Write a script that prompt the user to enter side a, side b, 
// and side c of the triangle and and calculate the perimeter of triangle (perimeter = a + b + c)

let a = prompt('Enter side 1', 'number goes here') //it works correctly
let b = prompt('Enter side 2', 'number goes here') //it works correctly
let c = prompt('Enter side 3', 'number goes here') //it works correctly
let perimeter = a + b + c
console.log("the perimeter of triangle is "+ perimeter)
